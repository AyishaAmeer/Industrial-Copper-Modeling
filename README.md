Introduction:

An industrial copper modeling problem typically involves the development of mathematical, statistical, or machine learning models to predict or optimize various aspects related to the production, utilization, or market behavior of copper in an industrial context.
 
Technical skills:  Python scripting, Data Preprocessing, EDA, and streamlit.

Project Approach:

Data Understanding: Identifying the types of variables (continuous or categorical).

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, Treat Outliers using IQR, Identify Skewness and Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques.

EDA: Visualizing outliers and skewness using Seaborn's boxplot, distplot, violinplot.

Feature Engineering:  Drop highly correlated columns using SNS HEATMAP.

Model Building and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing/validation sets. Train and evaluate different classification models, such as ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier, or Logistic Regression, using appropriate evaluation metrics 
                               such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC curve. Optimize model hyperparameters using techniques such as cross-validation and grid search to find the best-performing model.
                               Interpret the model results and assess its performance. Same steps for Regression modelling.
                               
Model GUI: Using streamlit module create interactive page.

Pickle: Using pickle module to dump and load modules.

The learning outcomes of this project are:

1.) Developing proficiency in Python programming language and its data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit.

2.) Gaining experience in data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, outlier detection, and data normalization to prepare data for machine learning modeling.

3.) Understanding and visualizing the data using EDA techniques such as boxplots, histograms, and scatter plots.

4.) Learning and applying advanced machine learning techniques such as regression and classification to predict continuous and binary target variables, respectively.

5.) Building and optimizing machine learning models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques such as cross-validation and grid search.

6.) Experience in feature engineering techniques to create new informative representations of the data.

7.) Developing a web application using the Streamlit module to showcase the machine learning models and make predictions on new data.

8.) Understanding the challenges and best practices in the manufacturing domain and how machine learning can help solve them.

Conclusion:

This project will equip with practical skills and experience in data analysis, machine learning modeling, and creating interactive web applications and providing with a solid foundation to tackle real-world problems in the manufacturing domain.
